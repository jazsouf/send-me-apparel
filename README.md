## Send Me Apparel

Send Me Apparel is a React application that allows users to customize and purchase t-shirts. The application is still under development, but it is already a powerful tool for creating custom t-shirts.

## Description

Send Me Apparel allows users to choose from a variety of colors, styles, and designs for their t-shirts. Users can also add their own text or images to their t-shirts. Once a user is happy with their design, they can place an order and their t-shirt will be shipped to them within a few days.

## Motivation

I was motivated to build Send Me Apparel because I wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for people to create custom t-shirts. I believe that everyone should have the ability to express themselves through their clothing, and I wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to do that.

## Problem Solved

Send Me Apparel solves the problem of finding and purchasing custom t-shirts. In the past, if you wanted to create a custom t-shirt, you had to either find a company that would print your design or learn how to print t-shirts yourself. Both of these options were time-consuming and expensive. Send Me Apparel eliminates these problems by providing a simple and affordable way to create custom t-shirts.

You can also add your own text or images to your t-shirt. Once you are happy with your design, you can place an order and your t-shirt will be shipped to you within a few days.
